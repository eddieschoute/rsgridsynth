//! Independent numerical verification that the synthesized channels actually meet their
//! requested diamond-norm accuracy budget -- entirely independent of this crate's own
//! closed-form `mixture_weight`/`diagonal_diamond_distance` formulas (this check does not
//! call either; it only reads final gate strings and probabilities and recomputes everything
//! from scratch).
//!
//! ## Arbitrary precision throughout, not `f64`
//!
//! Every quantity in this file -- matrix entries, Pauli transfer matrices, angular
//! differences -- is computed as `FBig<HalfEven>` at the crate's own working precision
//! (`rsgridsynth::common::get_prec_bits()`, set by whichever `synth_*` call ran most
//! recently), never downcast to `f64` until the final printed digits. An earlier version of
//! this file converted synthesized matrices to `f64` immediately and computed
//! `2*sqrt(1-Re(w)^2)`: at epsilon ~1e-8 the true angular error can be ~1e-9, at which point
//! `Re(w)` rounds to exactly `1.0` in `f64` (whose resolution near 1.0 is ~2.2e-16), and
//! squaring then subtracting from 1 amplified that rounding noise into a *floor* of
//! `2*sqrt(f64::EPSILON) ~= 3e-8` regardless of the true (much smaller) error -- a spurious
//! "budget exceeded" false positive that had nothing to do with the actual synthesis. Working
//! entirely in `FBig` removes that floor (down to whatever precision the crate itself used to
//! synthesize the candidate), and every angular quantity below is derived algebraically from
//! ring/complex arithmetic rather than by taking `atan2`/`acos` of an early-rounded `f64` and
//! re-differencing it (this crate does not implement arbitrary-precision inverse trig at all,
//! so the derivations below route around ever needing one -- see `phase_sq_from_z` and
//! `residual_cos_sin`).
//!
//! ## Two different, non-interchangeable ways to measure "how far" a channel is from target
//!
//! **Single Z-rotation vs. target Z-rotation** (`single_rotation_diamond_distance`): exact,
//! closed form, `2*|Im(w)|` (equal to `2*sqrt(1-Re(w)^2)` since `w` is unit-modulus, but
//! numerically stable -- see above). Always valid for comparing one pure rotation to another.
//!
//! **Pauli transfer matrix** (`ptm`/`pauli_diamond_distance_from_target`): computes
//! `Sum_P |delta_q_P|` from a channel's Pauli-basis decomposition. This closed form is only
//! mathematically valid when the *difference* between the channel and the target is itself
//! diagonal in the Pauli basis -- true for mixed diagonal's output (the {Z,S} twirl exists
//! specifically to enforce this by symmetrizing the off-diagonal X/Y error), but NOT true in
//! general for an untwisted single rotation mixed with something else: a lone Z-rotation by a
//! small angle delta genuinely mixes X and Y in its Pauli transfer matrix (that mixing IS what
//! the twirl is for), so applying the Pauli-diagonal shortcut to a channel that was never
//! twirled computes a meaningless number. An earlier version of this file made exactly that
//! mistake for fallback/mixed fallback and reported achieved errors around 1.0 (nonsense) for
//! everything, subsequently reduced to a state that *looked* plausible but was still wrong,
//! because the shortcut simply does not apply to the untwisted projective branch.
//!
//! ## The correct decomposition for fallback / mixed fallback
//!
//! Per the paper's own circuit description, the "success" outcome of the ancilla+measurement
//! circuit (out of scope for this crate) is an idealized rotation by `Arg(z)` -- not the raw
//! synthesized unitary's full matrix, whose off-diagonal component the projection removes.
//! The "failure" outcome is an idealized rotation by `Arg(v)`, followed by the ordinary
//! (non-projected) correction gate `B`. Since `B` is applied as an ordinary unconditional
//! unitary after a *fixed* rotation, and diamond norm is invariant under composing both sides
//! of a difference with the same fixed unitary channel, `B`'s own accuracy is exactly its
//! distance to the *residual* target angle `theta - Arg(v)` -- which is a fair question to ask
//! via the Pauli-diagonal shortcut, because `B` (a mixed-diagonal result) genuinely IS
//! twirled internally.
//!
//! So the right check is a **triangle-inequality upper bound**, combining an exact formula for
//! the untwisted success branch with a Pauli-diagonal-valid check for the twirled correction:
//!   `‖q*Z_{Arg z} + (1-q)*(B o Z_{Arg v}) - Z_theta‖⋄`
//!   `<= q * ‖Z_{Arg z} - Z_theta‖⋄  +  (1-q) * ‖B - Z_{theta-Arg(v)}‖⋄`
//! Both right-hand terms are independently exact/valid; the sum is a genuine, conservative
//! upper bound on the true (harder to compute exactly without twirling) diamond distance. If
//! this bound is <= the requested budget, that is a rigorous pass; if the bound exceeds the
//! budget, it does not by itself prove a failure (the true distance could still be smaller),
//! but it does mean this check cannot certify a pass and warrants a tighter look.
