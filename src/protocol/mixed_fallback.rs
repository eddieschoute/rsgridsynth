//! Stage 3: mixed fallback, composed from Stage 1 (mixed diagonal) and Stage 2 (fallback).
//!
//! Implements "mixed fallback" (Kliuchnikov, Lauter, Minko, Paetznick, Petit,
//! arXiv:2203.10064v2, Prop 3.16): the widest-tolerance, lowest-T-count protocol in the
//! paper, at the cost of one ancilla and one measurement (same as plain fallback) plus a
//! classical coin (same as mixed diagonal).
//!
//! There is no new region shape and no new number theory here -- per the paper (and the
//! parent design document), mixed fallback is composed from the two earlier stages exactly
//! as described in `crate::protocol::fallback`/`crate::protocol::mixed_diagonal`'s own docs:
//!
//! - The *projective* step searches [`crate::protocol::fallback::SectorRegion`] (Stage 2's
//!   region shape), but at the *wider* angular half-width used by the mixed protocols
//!   (`sin_alpha = sqrt(eps/2)`, vs. plain fallback's `eps/2`), and via a *straddling-pair*
//!   search (Stage 1's [`crate::protocol::mixed_diagonal::search_for_straddling_pair`], now
//!   generic over the region type) instead of a single-candidate search -- because mixed
//!   fallback needs two projective candidates (one under-, one over-rotating) to mix, exactly
//!   as mixed diagonal does.
//! - Each side's classical correction -- needed on that side's own "failure" branch,
//!   analogous to plain fallback's single correction -- is itself a full *mixed-diagonal*
//!   result (Stage 1's [`crate::protocol::mixed_diagonal::MixedDiagonalResult`], 8 twirled
//!   branches), not a single plain-diagonal gate word: the correction angle is derived via
//!   the same `atan2`-free half-angle algebra `fallback::synth_fallback` uses.
//! - Per the design document: the projective step itself is **not** twirled here (unlike
//!   mixed diagonal's projective step) -- the projective outcome is a genuine measurement
//!   branch whose "success" action is exactly a Z-rotation by construction of the (out of
//!   scope for this crate) ancilla circuit, so it has no off-diagonal error to twirl away.
//!   Only the fallback *corrections* -- ordinary unitaries, applied unconditionally once
//!   selected -- need the twirl, and get it automatically by being mixed-diagonal results.
